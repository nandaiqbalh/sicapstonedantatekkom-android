# SI Capstone TA Tekkom

This project addresses issues faced by our department, as the current Capstone TA business processes are still carried out manually using Google Forms and Google Spreadsheets. This causes several problems:
- For students: Difficulty in accessing information, registering, and uploading documents due to the excessive number of links, requiring them to double-check to ensure the correct links are used. 🔗🔄
- For lecturers: Challenges in monitoring the progress of the students they are supervising. 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫
- For the capstone management team: Difficulty in grouping students, scheduling defenses, and managing capstone groups, while also needing to balance the workload between lecturers and students. 📅⚖️

Therefore, we developed a management information system that consists of two platforms: web and Android. 💻📱
